One-to-One Explanation of Core Logic
The Educational Website is built using simple front-end web technologies, with JavaScript handling the interactive components.

# 1. Navigation and Course Categories:
The website's main page displays a navigation bar with different course categories. Clicking on a category filters the available content.

html
Copy code
<nav>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#math">Mathematics</a></li>
        <li><a href="#science">Science</a></li>
        <li><a href="#history">History</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>
The navigation links allow users to quickly jump to specific sections of the page.
2. Quizzes and Interactivity:
JavaScript is used to manage the quizzes, checking user answers and providing feedback.

javascript
Copy code
function checkAnswer(questionId, selectedAnswer) {
    let correctAnswer = document.getElementById(`correct-${questionId}`).value;
    if (selectedAnswer === correctAnswer) {
        alert("Correct!");
    } else {
        alert("Wrong answer, try again!");
    }
}
checkAnswer(): Compares the selected answer with the correct one and displays feedback to the user.
3. Responsive Design:
The website is fully responsive, thanks to Bootstrap and media queries in CSS, ensuring a smooth experience across all screen sizes.

css
Copy code
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .course-card {
        flex-direction: column;
    }
}
This media query adjusts the layout when the screen width is below 768px, stacking course cards vertically on smaller devices.
4. Video Integration:
Instructional videos are embedded from external platforms like YouTube, allowing students to watch lessons directly on the website.

html
Copy code
<div class="video-container">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sample_video_id" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
The embedded video is responsive and adjusts according to the user's screen size, providing a better viewing experience.
5. Study Materials Section:
Users can download study materials such as PDFs and documents related to each course.

html
Copy code
<a href="path_to_material.pdf" download>Download Study Material</a>
A simple link allows users to download educational content for offline use.
